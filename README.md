# Skltn

**Skeleton** or *skltn* (because nobody likes vowels these days) is a simple set of files and assets. It’s essentially the bare minimum you need to get your web project on it’s feet. 

To use this within your workflow simply clone (or fork) this repo grab a copy of [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), then add your folder as a Codekit project. Once you start to build you’re project within the [.kit](http://incident57.com/codekit/kit.php), [.scss](http://sass-lang.com/), [.less](http://lesscss.org/) files it will compile everything into the *build* folder for you. Once you’re done and ready to go live with you’re lovely website upload that *build* folder to your server and you’re ready to roll.
