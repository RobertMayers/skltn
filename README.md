# Skltn

**Skeleton** or *skltn* (because nobody likes vowels these days) is a simple set of files and assets. It’s essentially the bare minimum you need to get your web project on it’s feet. To use this as a workflow simply clone this repo grab a copy of [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/), then add your folder as a codekit project. Once you start to code you’re project within the .kit and .syour project all your files should compile into the *build* folder.
